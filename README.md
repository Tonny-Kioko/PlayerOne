🎮 Ready, Player One 🎮.
**Documentation for the Player One App**

I am an avid gamer and I always marvel at an opportunity to create solutions around games.🧑🏽‍💻 This is
an online platform that lets gamers find the games they like and purchase them🥳🥳. It will include
the most popular games as saved by most users, latest releases and recommendations.
This is my first Dart/Flutter 🤩😎project, and some of the features will not be as perfect as a commercial platform😅😅. I am however open to guidance on ways to improve its features💯💯. 

MAIN FEATURES
1. Showing games under the recommended ♾️, popular❤️ and according to their genres
-Here, I will add a section for the popular games. This will depend on the
games that the user visits over time.(It will depend on the popular games as included on registration until the user has enough visits).
-In the recommended section, I will add several games across multiple genres. Here, gamers can find the games enjoyed by many users on the platform.
